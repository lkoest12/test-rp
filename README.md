# Week 03 - Git and GitHub

For this week, we will cover version control using Git and GitHub.

## Get a GitHub User Account

First, you must make a user account on GitHub if you don't have one already. Be sure to choose a user ID that you are happy using for the rest of your professional career as a bioinformatician. GitHub is a very important tool for computational biology and if you continue working in data-intensive fields, you will be using this account again in the future. Join GitHub here:
